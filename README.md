# 👤 The Duterte Legacy

> *A new year does not always mean new beginnings.*

As 2026 approaches, we must not forget the events of the past. While the reign of terror may have ended, the pursuit of justice remains unfinished. This website is a personal project dedicated to raising awareness, calling for accountability, and giving a voice to those who suffered during Duterte’s administration in the Philippines.

This site presents factual statistics, historical context, and a clear call to action—urging people to stay informed, reflect critically, and speak out so that these events are never repeated. **History repeats itself only when it is forgotten.**
